Male subscribers are NYC Citi Bike's biggest clients.

## Summary
The peak riding times are when individuals are going to or leaving from work. Additionally, males use Citi Bikes significantly more than females. I would add a density heat map of the starting locations for Citi Bike riders. Also, I would add a comparison bar chart of usage of Citi Bikes on weekdays compared with weekends and perhaps a comparison over seasons.
